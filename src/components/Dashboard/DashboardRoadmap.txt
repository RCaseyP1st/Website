***

📊 If your focus is "Next-Level Insights" (data depth):
Monthly Completion % Trend

✅ Data exists

🔜 You need to group completions vs submissions by month and calculate %

Suggested chart: Line chart with two lines (Submissions vs. Completions) or a % bar per month

Monthly Referrals Volume

✅ Data exists (signposted resources)

🔜 Tally number of signposts by month

Suggested chart: Stacked bar or line chart for total per month

Reviews by Area/Region

✅ Postcode exists

🔜 Use first part of postcode (or map integration with clusters if desired)

Optional: Use Postcodes.io or simple string matching for grouping

🧭 If your focus is "Better Navigation & Filtering":
Submission Date Range Filter

🔜 Add dropdowns for Month/Year or a calendar picker

Should apply across all charts and metrics dynamically

Filter by Gender / Ethnicity / Age

✅ Data exists

🔜 You need UI buttons or dropdowns in the sidebar that filter all applicable charts

Consider using React context or URL query strings to persist the selected filter

🎨 If your focus is "UX Polish & Usability":
Expandable/Collapsible Sections

🔜 Add toggles to each metric group so users can collapse insights or filters

Helps with mobile usability too

Download Charts

🔜 Add buttons using html2canvas or Chart.js toBase64Image() to export visuals

Optional: Include print styles for PDF reports

Filter Persistence

❌ Currently not done

🔜 Store selected filters in localStorage or query strings so they reload on refresh
